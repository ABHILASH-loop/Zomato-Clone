# Zomato-Clone
A clone of the popular food delivery app Zomato, built using Android Jetpack Compose and following the MVVM architecture.

## Architecture
The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which separates the UI code from the data and business logic. The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the View (UI) and the Model (data), and provides the necessary data to the View to display.

## Libraries Used
- Android Jetpack Compose - UI toolkit for building native Android apps
- Retrofit - HTTP client for making API requests
- Firebase - Realtime database used to store and retrive required data for the app
- Navigation Component - Framework for implementing in-app navigation
- Coil - Image loading library for displaying images from the web
- Coroutines - Asynchronous programming library for managing background tasks

## Installation
To build and run the app, you'll need to have Android Studio 4.0 or higher installed on your computer. 
Clone the repository and open the project in Android Studio. Then, click on the "Run" button to launch the app on an emulator or a physical device.

``` git clone https://github.com/ABHILASH-loop/Zomato-Clone.git ```

## Credits
This app was developed as part of a learning project by ABHILASH-loop.
